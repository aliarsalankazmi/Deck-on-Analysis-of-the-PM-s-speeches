## Questions asked in News Channels & Social Media

>- Does the Prime Minister consult his advisors on diction for every speech or for ones delivered during extraordinary circumstances only?  
>- From his advisors, does the PM rely more on his family members?  
>- Has the PM's reliance on certain family members and aides increased only recently, as his government has come under increasing fire for involvement in large scale corruption?  
>- Is it possible to obtain information of such collaborations for other speeches of the PM?

Using Traditional Journalism to identify if different authors are involved in the PM's speeches is likely to be:
